# COVID-19-project

Project Description

This research project will explore the relationship between oppressive governments and the effectiveness of its Covid-19 pandemic response. We hypothesize that an oppressive government is less likely to have a robust and effective plan to combat the Covid-19 pandemic.  

The first step will be to outline a set of variables that can be used to define an oppressive government. In a literature review that we conducted prior to this project, some non-democratic or authoritarian-leaning nations effectively responded to the pandemic. We also noted some democratic governments had relatively poor responses to the pandemic. We hypothesize that oppressive governments may not be able to effectively prioritize their resources to develop an effective plan to fight off the pandemic, and that these outliers do not represent the relationship when data from a wider sample set is analyzed.

These datasets come in the form of either CSV, Excel, or Google Spreadsheets. With respect to data cleaning, we are planning to use Google Spreadsheets or Excel if the files come in either of these formats. We will convert all of these datasets into CSV format before combining and organizing the most relevant variables into a new dataframe using Rstudio. We may also seek to create new variables as appropriate to support the research process. Furthermore, we will be creating summary statistics and data visualizations to test our hypothesis and display their relationship more clearly.
